# Assignment 2 – Static Contact Sales Page

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **static web page** developed as part of **Assignment 2 for Web Development**.  
The objective was to translate a modern SaaS-style UI into a functional front-end layout using **pure HTML and CSS**, without relying on JavaScript or external frameworks.

The page replicates a **“Contact Sales”** interface inspired by contemporary enterprise platforms, focusing on clarity, layout balance, and visual hierarchy.
